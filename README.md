# Liam Requests
A repo filled with random little projects or files that my oldest son, Liam, requests.

## Completed Projects so far

### Random Pools
The "blue squares" are the pools. The grid itself and the items within it are random. Comes with a button to re-randomize so one doesn't have to restart the program for a new grid/block pattern.
